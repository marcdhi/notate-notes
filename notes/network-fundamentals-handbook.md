Here are comprehensive yet concise study notes from the given webpage content on Computer Networking Fundamentals:

## Computer Networking Fundamentals

### Computer Networking Basics For Developers
- **Networking** domain is broad, terminology can be confusing
- Focuses on **Data Link Layer (OSI L2)** of wired networks 
- **Ethernet** is the king of wired networking nowadays
- Touches upon neighboring layers (Physical, Network)

### Illustrated Introduction to Linux iptables
- Aims to explain **iptables** using layman's terms and visuals
- Avoids formal definitions and long command lists
- Provides insights before diving into tables, rules, targets, policies
- **Terminology** like tables, rules, targets, policies can be confusing

### A Visual Guide to SSH Tunnels
- **SSH Tunnels** enable:
  - Accessing internal VPC endpoints via public EC2 instance
  - Opening local ports in host's browser from dev VM
  - Exposing local servers to the outside world
- Covers **Local** and **Remote Port Forwarding**
- Includes **visual cheat sheet** and labs

### Bridge vs Switch
- Difference between **bridge** and **switch** was a mystery
- Some see them as different devices, not interchangeable
- Aims to clarify the distinction between the two

### Networking Lab: Ethernet Broadcast Domains
- **Broadcast domain**: nodes forming an L2 segment
- Can communicate using MAC addresses or broadcasting
- Multiple physical segments can be bridged into one broadcast domain
- Multiple L2 segments can be bridged into a bigger broadcast domain

### Networking Lab: L3 to L2 Segments Mapping
- Common to have single **IP subnet** over an L2 segment
- Possible to configure **multiple IP subnets** over single L2 domain
- Configuring **single IP subnet** over multiple L2 segments (Proxy ARP)

### Networking Lab: Simple VLAN
- Using **VLAN** capabilities of a switch
- To split a single broadcast domain into multiple smaller domains
