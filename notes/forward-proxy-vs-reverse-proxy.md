# Notes: proxying-paradigms

## Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

### What is a Forward Proxy?

- **Forward proxy** acts as an intermediary between clients and external servers
- Intercepts outbound requests from clients and forwards them to destinations

**Key Features:**

- **Client-Side Proxying:** Deployed on the client side, serving as a gateway for outbound traffic
- **Anonymity and Privacy:** Masks client IP addresses, enhancing privacy
- **Content Filtering and Caching:** Filters content and caches frequently accessed resources
- **Security and Access Control:** Enforces security policies and regulates access to external resources

### What is a Reverse Proxy?

- **Reverse proxy** operates on the server side, acting as a front-end facade for backend servers
- Intercepts incoming requests from clients and forwards them to appropriate backend servers

**Key Features:**

- **Server-Side Proxying:** Deployed in front of backend servers, accepting incoming requests
- **Load Balancing and Traffic Distribution:** Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers
- **SSL Termination and Encryption:** Handles SSL/TLS termination, offloading encryption/decryption
- **Content Delivery and Optimization:** Caches static content, compresses data, and optimizes delivery

### Differences and Use Cases

**Forward Proxy:**
- Shields clients from external networks
- Enhances privacy and security
- Enforces access controls and anonymity
- Ideal for individual users, organizations, or networks requiring outbound traffic management

**Reverse Proxy:**
- Front-end for backend servers
- Improves scalability and performance
- Provides centralized management of incoming traffic
- Ideal for web servers, application servers, or microservices architectures requiring load balancing, SSL termination, and content optimization

### Key Points

- **Forward proxies** focus on client-side traffic management and security
- **Reverse proxies** excel at server-side load balancing, scalability, and optimization
- Understanding their differences is essential for designing resilient, efficient, and secure systems
