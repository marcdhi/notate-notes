# Notes: video-processing-innovators

# Netflix Engineering Notes

## Video Processing at Netflix's Scale

- **Video encoding pipeline** uses AWS EC2 instances for scalability
- **Long encoding jobs** are divided into smaller chunks for parallel processing
- Migrated from centralized linear encoding to **distributed chunk-based encoding** with microservices architecture
- **Automated quality control checks** detect issues like picture corruption, black frames, etc.

## Move to GraphQL

- Migrated mobile apps from monolith Falcor API to **GraphQL** with zero downtime
- **Phase 1:** Created GraphQL shim service on top of Falcor API for A/B testing
- **Phase 2:** Used **Replay Testing** and **Sticky Canary** experiments for functional correctness

## Launch of Ads on Netflix

- Simulated projected traffic using **AB testing platform** and **data science projections**
- Created **duplicate production environment** for replaying traffic as Basic with ads plan
- Incrementally increased replay traffic to 100% for testing

## History of Chaos Engineering

- Introduced **Chaos Monkey** for randomly terminating instances
- **FIT (Failure Injection Technology)** for injecting failures into microservices
- Used **Request Contexts** and **Canary strategy** for more granular testing
- **CRR (Custom Resource Routing)** for stickiness in canary experiments
- Extensive **monitoring** of event data, logs, and counters

## Netflix Open Connect Program (OCP)

- Globally distributed **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** for reducing server traffic
- **Open Connect Appliances (OCAs)** store and serve video files
- OCAs installed at **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)** and directly into ISP networks
- Almost all Netflix content served from OCAs located worldwide
