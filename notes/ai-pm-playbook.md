# Notes: ai-pm-playbook

Here are comprehensive yet concise study notes from the given webpage content, following the provided format guidelines:

## The AI PM's Playbook

### The 3 Types of AI PMs
- **AI-powered PM**: Every PM who needs to use AI to work more effectively
- **AI PM**: Specialists building core AI products at companies like OpenAI, Anthropic
- **AI feature PM**: PMs adding AI features to existing products

### The 3 Rules to Using AI Right

#### Rule 1 - Prompt skill is everything
- Optimal prompting structure is crucial for getting the best results
- Example prompt structure for ChatGPT:
  - Provide context and background information
  - Specify the task or output desired
  - Give examples or constraints

#### Rule 2 - 20-60-20
- Provide 20% of the context and relevant information upfront
- AI generates the middle 60% of the output based on the provided context
- Revise the last 20% to remove AI traces and add unique human context

#### Rule 3 - Revise till you get what you want
- Iterate and refine the AI output through multiple drafts
- Provide clear and specific feedback for the AI to incorporate
- Optimal output is usually achieved in drafts 4-5

### Top 5 AI PM Use Cases

#### Use Case 1 - PRDs
- Use AI to generate comprehensive PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)
- Provide context, constraints, examples, and desired output format
- Recommended tools: Claude, ChatPRD, ChatGPT

#### Use Case 2 - Strategy docs
- Use AI to articulate and defend product strategy principles
- Provide key context inputs like experiment results, customer insights, technical limitations, etc.
- Feed AI a well-received strategy doc from your company as an example

#### Use Case 3 - Competitive research
- Use AI to gain insights on new competitors, feature comparisons, pricing strategies, user sentiment
- Feed AI the competitor information and ask for specific analyses
- Example: AI report on a hypothetical competitor for Lemlist (Instantly)

#### Use Case 4 - Meeting updates
- Use AI to transcribe meetings and generate next steps and notes
- Recommended tools: Otter.ai, meeting tool AI transcripts (e.g., Zoom AI)
- Alternatively, paste transcripts into ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude for updates

#### Use Case 5 - Scaling prototyping and design iteration
- Use AI to rapidly generate clickable prototypes and design iterations
- Recommended tool: Claude Artifacts for wireframes
- Iterate by tweaking prompts and generating new versions quickly

### Common Mistakes

#### Mistake 1 - Letting AI think instead of write
- AI cannot understand context, failed experiments, customer feedback, or internal constraints
- Feed AI context, guide its output, and enhance with your insights

#### Mistake 2 - Forgetting to remove the AI
- Treat AI output as a first draft
- Verify and update with current market knowledge, competitor landscape, and user insights

#### Mistake 3 - Outdated Tools
- The AI landscape evolves rapidly; regularly test and evaluate new tools
- Build a testing framework and spend time monthly trying new AI solutions

### Final Words
- Start by failing fast and learning faster with AI
- Develop your own style but keep trying the latest tools
- Measure and improve your skills across all use cases
